LegiTest is a Visual Studio extension that provides a set of functionality tailored around testing data. Using a simple graphical designer, unit tests that run on standard testing frameworks can be created through code generation. LegiTest aims to take the pain out of data testing by putting you in touch with the elements that matter most to you - databases, queries, SSIS packages, SSRS reports etc. By generating the code required to interact with these types of target, LegiTest reduces the investment required to bring your data into your testing lifecycle.
