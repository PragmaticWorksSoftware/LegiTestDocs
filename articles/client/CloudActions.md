# Cloud Actions



Cloud actions are responsible for gathering data by connecting to Salesforce or other sites that provide a REST API. Each action can be used to fulfill a unique roll within a test:

- They can prepare tests by ensuring the expected results are up to date.

- Clean-up an environment before or after a test execution.
