# Uniqueness

![](images/RecipesConfiguration.png)





The Uniqueness recipe allows us to select a table that we want to check for duplicates, and also select the columns that make up the unique key for that check. So, in the example above, we are checking that the table 'dbo.Solution' does not have more than 1 row for each pair of 'SolutionId' and 'AccountId'.
