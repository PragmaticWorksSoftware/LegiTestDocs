# Integrating with LegiTest Server or LegiTest Online



LegiTest generated code includes the ability to publish detailed test results to a server system. This goes above and beyond what you might see from a standard test framework - each of the individual elements within a test become visible on the server every time they are run. Detailed results can also be found - rather than just a message saying 'your grid comparison failed' you get to see what that grid actually looked like.



Other benefits available with server integration are the ability to publish tests and run them automatically on a schedule, the ability to annotate your tests to give meaningful business descriptions to them and the ability to specify what parts of your system are covered by the tests that you have implemented.
