# Getting Started

## Creating An Account
Once at LegiTest Online, click "Sign in to started" to be taken to the log in page. From here
you can either create an account or use an external log in such as Microsoft or Google. If creating your own account
you will need to supply an email address and create a password. Once entered, click "Register". 

Once registed, you will recieve an email from "support@pragmaticworks.com" to confirm the account creation. Once confirmed, the account will be fully
activated and you can begin using LegiTest Online.

## Sharing Accounts
All the data stored on LegiTest Online is specific to each account. However, accounts can send invites to other users. This invite
enables an account to be created that has access to the same data. This allows for organizations to all use and view the same data in one spot,
while not having to share accounts and passwords.
