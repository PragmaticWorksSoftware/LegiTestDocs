# Notifications
The notification system for LegiTest Online provides a robust way for users to stay informed on what is going on with their tests. Notification [subscriptions](subscriptions.md) set up by the user can send emails, text messages, create VSTS work items, and much more.

Users can also create [Actions](actions.md) that can be manually triggered for an individual row in Grid Comparison/Validation rows that are part of an Assertion result set found on the Assert Details page. Actions and Subscriptions both use the various configurable [Notification Targets](targets.md) and customizable [Templates](templates.md) to provide a highly customizable experience.
